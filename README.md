# taskplanner
Task Planner was created by Ivana and Kriss while students in the Generation Australia Junior Web Development program. \
It stores a list of tasks in browser local storage. \
Task Planner displays tasks by creating cards from a string with card HTML for each task. \
The card is styled with Bootstrap, and it is appended to the document body. \
The task planner does not use a framework or library such as Angular or React.

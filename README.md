# Personal Planner
Personal Planner was created by Ivana and Kriss while students in the Generation Australia Junior Web Developer program. \
It stores a list of tasks in browser local storage. \
The Personal Planner displays tasks by creating cards from a template literal (or template string) which contains card HTML.  \
The string is interpolated with data from each task. \
The card DIV has a class attribute with the value "card" in order to be styled with Bootstrap, and it is appended to the document body. \
Personal Planner does not use a framework or library such as Angular or React. \
